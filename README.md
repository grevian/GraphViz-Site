# GraphViz for Discrete Math Students

This project is a simple web interface to GraphViz using [App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine) and the [Google
Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/) to render Graphviz dot files, I wrote it while taking the MATH2056 
course at Algoma University, to help myself and others who needed to draw graphs 
for various problems including Euler and Hamiltonian Circuits and Paths, as 
well as Dijkstra's Algorithm and other graph and tree applications. I wrote 
a set of examples and a quick reference for the features I found myself using,
and wrapped it all up in an easily accessible website format for others to use 

## Setup

You can register for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/) account, install the [gcloud SDK tools](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts), clone this
